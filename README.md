# Homework5
This project is about the Clonity team.

    We have created one page (index.html);
        in html document there are head, and body elements, in body there is no header, but we have main and footer. in main we can see only one section, which by the way contains div-s and the main structure is created using display-flex.

    For styling there is reset.css and style.css;
        in reset file we have reseted all default styles for our componentes;
        style css is used for styling main and footer components.
    

    
    One main folder is created for images content. 
        the "image" folder is devided to main and footer folders, where we have our svg and png images.

Thanks for your attention <3
